### A NOVEL LEARNING EXPERIENCE

Nabu is a project developed by students of the Technische Hochschule Ulm as part of the
Software Project module. As a gamified learning app it strives to incentivize active learning
through the medium of play. A satisfactory user experience entails the ability to use the
software as a learning aid for both students and teachers. The former being able to track their
learning process via a fun, interactive medium, the latter creating easily accessible
information and quizzes to test students' knowledge of lecture topics.

Nabu is a web application that was developed using industry standard JS frameworks such as
React and Node. To ensure a smooth user experience, data is trasmitted to the server using a
streamlined routing system to ensure stability (see below)
