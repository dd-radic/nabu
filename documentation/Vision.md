	<h1>Vision Document</h1>
	<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
	<p> Learning is often more effective when it feels like play. Many educational apps use quizzes,but these can become repetitive and boring. A learning app with interactive puzzles and gamification can improve engagement while reinforcing knowledge. This project focuses on developing a mobile/web application that delivers various puzzle-based learning activities with progress tracking and rewards. The emphasis is on app development (frontend + backend), user experience, and gamification mechanics.</p>

	<h2>2.1 Problem Statement</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Problem</th>
			<td>Disorganized learning materials and exercises in learning environments<br>Existing classroom learning/exercise structure sometimes demotivating</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Affects</th>
			<td>Lecturers and students in learning environments</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Impact</th>
			<td>For lecturers: increased workload (difficulty revising material, manually grading exercises, organizing documents)
			<br>For students: low learning enthusiasm and ensuing suboptimal performance, difficulty estimating progress</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Solution</th>
			<td>Customizable, user-friendly gamified learning platform</td>

			<th>Benefit</th>
			<td>Standardized learning materials (e.g. flashcards, presentations, digital exercises)<br>Gamified learning exercises drive enthusiasm and engagement<br>Progress tracking helps organize study priority, e.g. finding points of struggle</td>

			<th>Primary Market Alternative</th>
			<td>Kahoot</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Primary Differentiation</th>
			<td>Gamification scope</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p> Gamification has been shown in numerous studies to have an incentivizing effect toward continued - even habitual - use of software products. </p>
	<p> This element has been leveraged by numerous previous learning productivity products e.g. Kahoot, Duolingo, Quizlet, Khan Academy. Nabu aims toward a similar goal, with the most analogous example being Kahoot, however Nabu aims to include more explicitly gamified elements for users e.g. Duolingo.</p> <p>This broader and deeper presence of gamified elements will drive continued and repetitive use by prospective users.</p>

	<h2>3.2 User Environment</h2>
	<br>
	<p>There are several groups of target users: lecturers, students, and independent learners. 
	Lecturers will be working alone to develop supplementary learning materials in the app. These learning materials will then be distributed to the students in their class so they can interact with the app, thus helping their learning. These lecturers will most likely want to set up private classrooms for their students to participate in. </p>
	<p>Today, teachers commonly use apps like Kahoot or Quizlet to promote learning among their class through academic competition. 
	Students will be working in groups to participate in games organized by the lecturers, or on their own to develop independent learning materials such as flashcards or quizzes. The students could be the end user for material developed by the lecturer or the end user of material they developed themselves. </p>
	<p>Students will most likely want to create public classrooms where they can share material they have created with their peers.
	Independent learners are effectively students for the purpose of creating learning materials for themselves. These learners will also want to search for learning materials available on the app's public classrooms.
