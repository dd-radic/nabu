# NABU 𒍪

### A NOVEL LEARNING EXPERIENCE

Nabu is a project developed by students of the Technische Hochschule Ulm as part of the Software Project module. As a gamified learning app it strives to incentivize active learning through the medium of play.

A satisfactory user experience entails the ability to use the software as a learning aid for both students and teachers. The former being able to track their learning process via a fun, interactive medium, the latter creating easily accessible information and quizzes to test students' knowledge of lecture topics.
